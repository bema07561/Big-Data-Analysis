# README: Big Data Analysis Projects

## Overview
This repository contains projects from the **Big Data Analysis Class** at Beijing Institute of Technology. The projects explore graph databases, neural networks, text analysis, regression modeling, and knowledge graph creation.

---

## Projects

### 1. **Graph Database | Neo4j**
- Created a graph database with over 100 nodes and multiple relationships.  
- Used Neo4j for querying and data visualization.

---

### 2. **Neural Networks | PyTorch**
- Experimented with activation functions and network designs.  
- Added validation phases for testing model performance.

---

### 3. **Text Analysis | Word2Vec**
- Tokenized text and generated skip-grams.  
- Visualized word vectors for semantic understanding.

---

### 4. **Regression Model | TensorFlow**
- Built a regression model to predict alcohol consumption using physiological data.

---

### 5. **Knowledge Graphs | NetworkX, SpaCy**
- Extracted knowledge graphs from text.  
- Visualized relationships between entities.

---

## Tools Used
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Frameworks & Libraries:** Neo4j, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Word2Vec, SpaCy, NetworkX
